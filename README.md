With an easy to use GUI, set up and create a Bingo game that best suits your play style. Choose from the following options:

## Game Modes
### Speed Run
Every time you tick off an item on your card, your hunger, health, saturation and rockets (if the flying kit is enabled) are restored allowing you to continue speed runing your bingo card.

### Traditional
Old school bingo, tick off items to complete the game. You need to watch your hunger and health in this mode!

### Random
Can't decide what to play? Why not use the random mode to let the plugin choose for you.

## Card Difficulty & Size
The items used to populate your card are split in to 5 groups. Easy, Normal or Hard modes change the distribution used to generate your bingo cards. Choose between a Small (3x3), Medium (4x4) or Large (5x5) card to battle out your epic bingo games!

Both difficulty and card size also come with a Random option to help mix up your bingo games.

## Card Type
### Unique Card
All players are given a unique card. The plugin pulls a list of items slightly larger than the selected card size, shuffles them and generates a unique card for each player. This is done to ensure players have similar cards but the order is completley different for every player.

### Identical Card
All players receive the exact same card. No excuses for losing in this mode!

### Random
As with the other settings, you can also roll with a random card type. Seeing a bit of a trend here?

## Win Condition
With single row and full card options, the battles are sure to be epic. And you guessed it, this also comes with a random mode. When playing single row, this can be in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line.

## Reveal Cards
With this mode enabled, every time a player ticks an item off all the other players are told what the item is. Without it enabled, it uses a more cryptic "ticked off an item" message instead. Enabling this will also allow players to open their bingo card, click the spyglass and see the bingo card of anyone playing the current bingo game.

## Time Limit
Want to ensure you have some insane and fast fun? Why not try a timed game. Select from 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50 or 60 minute games. If no one completes the win condition in this time, the game simply ends. Or why not try the Unlimited Time games, where players receive a speed boost after 20, 40 and 60 minutes of game play.

## Player Loadout
Game kits help make your games more epic and cater to a wide variety of players. Select a kit to equip to all players at the start of the game.

### Naked Kit

This kit as the name implies gives your players an entirely empty inventory. Perfect for those players who enjoy punching that first tree and want to grind their gear (and bingo card).

### Starter Kit
